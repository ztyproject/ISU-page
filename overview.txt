The International Student Union was founded in 2008, with the initial suggestion coming from the School of International Education. It was agreed upon that the main framework would be designed similar to that of the current Chinese Student Unions. They set out to elect individuals who were willing and capable of handling such responsibilities. Due to the fact that South China University of Technology's School of International Education was in its infant stages, there was not a large contingent to choose from. Nevertheless, a few students with certain educational leadership pedigree rose up to take up roles in the newly formed student union. Some of their responsibilities included management of sporting, lifestyle, educational and entertaining activities and more. 

The International Student Union(ISU) of South China University of Technology(SCUT) has and always will be a symbol of hope to all international students. Since its inception it has been a home away from home and it shall continue for many years to come.

We have a handful of departments where you can share ideas and apply your skills. We present a great platform for international students to give back to SCUT and to apply their knowledge and skills in an interractive and open way.

The core mission of the International Student Union is to provide support to international students who are far from home. Furthermore, it is to connect with each other; to educate one another about differences and similarities among our cultures, while embracing each others’ diversified nature.

The goals of the International Student Association are:
•	To create a better social and cultural atmosphere for all international and local students at South China University of Technology.
•	To assist all international students with their cultural transition and assimilation at the university.
•	To promote mutual assistance and to advance the cause of international students in cooperation with the university’s management, to improve and enforce policies toward international students, and to resolve any problems an international student may encounter on campus through mutual assistance and practice.
•	To promote awareness of various cultures among international students as well as Chinese students for the benefit of the surrounding community and ourselves.
